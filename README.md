A config-like syntax for defining Pipelines. See [the
wiki](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-config-plugin/wiki/Getting-Started)
for more information on how to use it.

For developing this: 

`cd pipeline-model-definition && mvn install && mvn hpi:run`

Look in the [SYNTAX.md](SYNTAX.md)SYNTAX.md for a description of the Syntax somewhat formally which should be kept up to date. 

For extending, and the api information, consult [EXTENDING.md](EXTENDING.md)
